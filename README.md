# Tesla Stock Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting Tesla stock prices. The model utilizes a dataset spanning from 2012 to 2018 and is capable of predicting stock prices for the next 10 years or the next 10 days, depending on the chosen parameters.
Requirements

Clone the repository:
```bash
    https://github.com/Xer0bit/TeslaStockPrediction
```

To run the code, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model covers historical Tesla stock data from 2012 to 2018. This dataset is used to train the machine learning model for predicting future stock prices.
Usage


Run the prediction script: *main.ipynb*

This will run the prediction model and provide the predicted Tesla stock prices for the next 10 years or 10 days.
